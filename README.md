# cybersecurity_threat_detection
ðŸ“Œ Overview:
Modern cyber attacks are fast, adaptive, and often designed to bypass traditional security systems. Static rule-based tools are not enough to detect new and unseen attack patterns in real time. This project addresses this challenge by developing a real-time cybersecurity threat detection system that uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) â€” a powerful deep learning model â€” to analyze sequences of network traffic and predict potential threats.

The system includes a Streamlit-based user interface, providing live visual feedback, predictions, and analytics in a browser-based dashboard.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals:
Capture and analyze real-time or simulated network traffic.

Use LSTM to detect anomalous patterns that may indicate cybersecurity threats (e.g., intrusions, DoS attacks, brute-force attempts).

Provide an easy-to-use Streamlit UI to monitor, visualize, and interact with the modelâ€™s predictions.

Allow for file upload (e.g., CSV logs) or real-time updates.

Display prediction confidence, threat type (optional), and a threat timeline.
